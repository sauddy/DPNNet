# DPNNet
Disk Planet Neural Network.
This is an updated version of the code used in the DPNNet paper by Auddy and Lin 2020. 
Here we have considered data from Flared disk compared to non-flared disk earlier.
The code is not yet optimized. 

Please refer to the DPNNet paper for details regarding the Network setup.
